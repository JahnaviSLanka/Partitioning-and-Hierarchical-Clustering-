# Partitioning-and-Hierarchical-Clustering-
The objective of this study is to find the appropriate number of clusters with the help of elbow method and performing diagnostics using k-means and principal components. To build hierarchical clustering that is a good model for outlier detection and that is a good model for partitioning data into (approximately) equal sized groups.
